# heart strings

I remembered yesterday,
standing on your carpet
how it is that a violin makes its sound.

   like this

The bow bonds with the string
and as it is drawn,
pulls the string with it.

The string bends out of shape
stretching to its limit to follow the bow
until such a point
it can not stand it anymore.

Then, under its own tension,
it lets go,

returning to its natural state.

This cycle repeats thousands of times a second.

Attachment, bending, letting go
into attachment again

And from that process
a note emerges.

I read a book once that said
that in falling in love,
we bond with another.

That we bend ourselves
to our limits
to maintain that bond
until such a point that
we cannot stand it anymore

and in that moment

we let go of each other
to hold onto ourselves.

I don't know if this is true,

but standing on your carpet,

I wondered if perhaps this is why
the sound of a violin
can fill me with such sadness

that perhaps our hearts
obey the same mechanism

and as I listen to a single note,

my heart is resonating with
 a thousand stories
of love and loss
